# Advent of code 2023 (Elixir edition)
*by Disguised Pigeon*

### ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
Bad code ahead

My best try at learning elixir while doing the advent of code[^aoc] this year.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015. Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days. You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
